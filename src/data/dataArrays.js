      '-- As reported by BERNAMA, Yeap Gaun Fong, the owner of 8321 Durian Plantation asserted that the hot weather is affecting the harvesting of the king of fruits. \n\n -- According to durian grower Yeap Gaun Fong, the prolonged hot weather in Malaysia has not only caused low demand for durians; it also resulted in lower production of the fruits. Yeap said that the harvest for durian this season is 30 per cent lower compared with last year. “The hot weather is the main reason why people eat less durians. We had many visitors but they only bought one or two fruits…they said that the weather was too hot to consume many durians. \n\n -- He said that the prices for the king of fruits have also dropped for the past two weeks due to low demand. Yeap, who owns six durian plantations across Penang, added that there has been about a 50 per cent of price drop this season compared with last year.'

In Langkawi, Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan, the maximum prices of the items differ based on zones and districts. \n\n Meanwhile, commenting on grain corn, which is almost 100% imported from Argentina and Brazil and affects the price of chicken and eggs, Mohamad said the government was encouraging its cultivation in Malaysia this year."

They can even do long-distance farming. Say you're at home, you can see all the readings on your phone, so you can control it,” Mr Chang told The Straits Times.  \n\n  -- “Everything is very precise; there is no wastage.” IoT devices can also be used for greenhouse climate control, crop monitoring, precision fertilisation and other tasks."

      '-- Padi farmers in the Kuala Sungai area of Alor Star are worried about the potential impact of the upcoming El Nino phenomenon on their livelihoods. Already struggling with rising operational costs and poor irrigation canal management, the farmers fear that a prolonged dry spell could devastate over 1,000 smallholders. The farmers have been experiencing inadequate canal maintenance for the past 20 years, forcing them to spend their own money on repairs and water pumps. They are appealing to the Agriculture and Food Security Minister to upgrade the irrigation canal. In response, the Muda Agricultural Development Authority (Mada) has stated that they are prepared to handle the expected dry spell, assuring farmers that the water supply in the Muda area reservoirs will meet their needs. However, Mada will remain vigilant and implement conservation measures if the El Nino phenomenon occurs as predicted.  \n\n  -- The farmers are concerned that the El Nino phenomenon, combined with existing challenges, could have severe financial consequences. They face additional costs each time their crops fail, including fertilizing the soil and purchasing new seeds. Furthermore, government handouts have proven ineffective in improving their financial situation as landlords raise rental rates when subsidies are announced. The farmers are calling for government intervention to address the canal management issues and provide support during this challenging period. The state government is considering cloud seeding operations to manage the anticipated dry spell, while advising residents to stay indoors and remain hydrated. The situation remains closely monitored to protect the health and livelihoods of the affected farmers in Kedah. '

The MoU aims to enhance cooperation and strengthen Malaysia's position in the Chinese market. MPOB's director-general, Datuk Dr Ahmad Parveez Ghulam Kadir, stated that the agency's research and development initiatives have expanded the use of palm oil in value-added food industries, securing the market for Malaysian palm oil. The cooperation between Malaysia and China will also involve technological exploration of oil palm mechanization, including the implementation of artificial intelligence, 5G networks, Internet of Things, and autonomous vehicles in Malaysian plantations. CFNA will include the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification in its guidelines and promote MSPO in China.  \n\n  -- China was Malaysia's second-largest export market for palm oil in 2022, accounting for 11.2% of total Malaysian palm oil exports. The total export value of palm oil and palm-based products from Malaysia to China increased by 12.9% to RM14.86 billion in 2022 compared to RM13.16 billion in 2021. The export volume also saw a slight increase from 3.13 million tonnes in 2021 to 3.14 million tonnes in 2022. The collaboration between MPOB and CFNA, along with other initiatives such as partnerships with Tsinghua University and Chinese companies, is expected to further boost the trade relationship between Malaysia and China in the palm oil sector."

Zoo Negara deputy director Rosly@Rahmat Ahmat Lana said the Chinese government has given the green light for Malaysia to return the two panda cubs after it was delayed for several years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 'However, the actual delivery date has not yet been ascertained, but it may be in the middle of May. The panda cubs will be sent directly to Chengdu,' he told Bernama.  \n\n  -- The giant panda pair of Fu Wa and Feng Yi was loaned to the Malaysian government in 2014 for 10 years, in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Malaysia and China. The loan programme under the Giant Panda Conservation International Collaboration Programme Agreement allows Malaysia to conduct research on Giant Panda conservation, in addition to developing and training local expertise. To date, the panda pair, which were renamed Xing Xing and Liang Liang (female), has given birth to three cubs, namely Nuan Nuan who was born on Aug 18, 2015; Yi Yi on Jan 14, 2018; and Sheng Yi on May 30, 2021. \n\n  -- According to the agreement, each giant panda cub must be sent back to China when it reaches 24 months of age and no more than four years old.

      "Malaysian influencer '_erynamira' sparked online controversy after posting a TikTok video attempting to prove the existence of 'pretty privilege.' In the video, she and her companion visit a restaurant and use flirtatious pickup lines to receive free food from a waiter. The video went viral, with many users engaging in a passionate debate about the concept of pretty privilege. While some agreed with the influencer's claims, others found the antics cringeworthy and presumptuous. However, allegations soon surfaced that the entire scene was staged as a marketing stunt, with the influencer being invited to promote the restaurant. A friend of the featured waiter shared a conversation screenshot suggesting that it was just a scripted scenario. \n\n  -- This incident is not the first time '_erynamira' has faced backlash. In a previous video, she stated her preference for dating someone from the T20 (top 20% income earners) rather than the B40 (bottom 40% income earners) group, sparking criticism for her perceived arrogance and discrimination. However, some defended her right to personal preferences in dating. \n\n  -- The controversy surrounding '_erynamira' highlights the ongoing discussion about pretty privilege and the advantages that individuals perceived as attractive may experience. While the influencer's video and subsequent allegations may have garnered attention, it also sparked a larger conversation about the ethics and authenticity of such social media content."

      "There's no doubt that farming practices have come a long way in the thousands of years people have grown crops and held cattle. But how did we come to the level of technology we're using today, and what further advances should we expect? Keep on reading to find out. \n\n 1.Low-tech mechanization of farmers technology \n\n -- Humans have been cultivating crops and cattle for over 10,000 years. And throughout most of that time, we've been trying to come up with increasingly newer, better, and more efficient ways to carry out agricultural operations. This started with relatively simple wooden and metal tools, and the technology has advanced all the way to plows, seeders, harvesters, and tractors. But all of these tools are part of low-tech mechanization, which replaces or simplifies hard labor that was previously carried out by humans but doesn't have an intelligence component that would allow the tech to aid farmers in making decisions. \n\n 2.High-tech mechanization of farmers technology \n\n -- Over the past few years, agriculture has started its transition from low-tech to high-tech mechanization. This new type of technology is much more flexible and can adjust to different working environments and tasks. High-tech farmers' technology uses a variety of sensors and software solutions that utilize artificial intelligence and data analysis. As a result, these devices can perform tasks even more precisely than humans, collect information using sensors, and use that information to make decisions. \n\n  Interestingly, high-tech mechanization has been predicted for many decades. However, it's only starting to appear in our fields today due to incredible progress in technology and the low cost of high-powered computers. In livestock farming, these high-tech devices are represented by automatic milking, egg collection, and barn cleaning machines, and feed dispensers. At the same time, in arable agriculture, autonomous tractors and devices that enable autonomous steering have been at the forefront of technological advances. \n\n 3.The future of farmers technology development \n\n --While technology has come a long way, there are still many challenges that need to be solved. For instance, while tractor autosteering technology such as FieldBee is widely available today, fully autonomous tractors still exist primarily as test models that researchers are developing. "

      "Types of Green Technology for Your Home. \n\n --You can implement green technology in nearly any part of your home. By switching to green tech, you'll save money, energy and will be helping the environment. Here are some of the types of green technology you can incorporate into your home for a more eco-friendly lifestyle. \n\n 1. Recycling Bin \n\n --Recycling is a fundamental and affordable green technology that plays a crucial role in waste management. When you recycle, the process of sorting and properly recycling materials at recycling centers involves the use of green technology. With the average American generating almost five pounds of waste daily, recycling can make a significant impact in improving the environment. By committing to recycling, you contribute to positive change and sustainability. \n\n 2. Solar Panels \n\n -- Solar panels are a prominent example of green technology. With their high efficiency and versatility, they can be installed almost anywhere as long as there is sunlight. Whether you choose to install them yourself or hire professionals, solar panels harness energy from the sun to power your home, leading to long-term savings on energy bills. \n\n 3. Smart Thermostat \n\n --Investing in a smart thermostat is a wise choice for a green technology upgrade in your home. Instead of manually adjusting your thermostat daily, smart thermostats automatically regulate the temperature, reducing energy wastage. By setting up a program, you can ensure that your home is efficiently heated or cooled when needed, avoiding unnecessary energy consumption when the house is empty. This technology optimizes energy usage and helps lower your utility bills. \n\n 4.Rain Barrels \n\n --Rain barrels are an excellent green technology for collecting and storing rainwater. With a faucet at the bottom, the stored water can be easily accessed whenever needed. This is particularly beneficial for large gardens as using rainwater for irrigation reduces overall water consumption and saves money. Additionally, since rainwater does not require transportation, utilizing it is environmentally friendly, contributing to sustainability efforts. \n\n 5.Smart Power Strips \n\n -- Smart power strips are a convenient solution to reduce energy waste. They turn off devices completely, preventing unnecessary energy consumption and saving you money. By eliminating 'energy vampires', smart power strips help protect the environment. "
